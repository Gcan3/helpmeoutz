# helpmeoutz


In this repository, I make a sample website with simple backend coding to post something then display that post from the database.

To make this accessible in a new localhost database:
1. Create a database name 'helpmeoutz'
2. Creat two tables 'user_form' and 'user_requests'
3. For 'user_form' make columns for email, password, username, cpassword
4. For 'user_requests' make columns for request_key (primary), request_user, request_topic, request_main, request_image, request_country, request_city, and request_email.
5. Delete sample.txt from upload_request folder.
6. Use your own Google cloud OAuth ID and Secret key
7. Run index.php
